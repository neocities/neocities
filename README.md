The web site for Neocities! It's open source. Want a feature on the site? Send a pull request!

## Getting Started

Neocities can be quickly launched in development mode with [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com). Vagrant builds a virtual machine that automatically installs everything you need to run Neocities as a developer. Install Vagrant, then from the command line:

```
vagrant up --provision
```

![Vagrant takes a while, make a pizza while waiting](https://i.imgur.com/dxpKVRi.gif)

```
vagrant ssh
bundle exec rackup -o 0.0.0.0
```

Now you can access the running site from your browser: http://127.0.0.1:9292
