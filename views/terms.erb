      <p><strong>Note: This was generated by a robot on the internet or something. It probably sucks. It's probably not good for us. We will be finding a bored/affordable lawyer to make this actually make sense for our goals (and retaining the creative ownership of your sites) soon. In the interim, please bear with us. Thanks. -Kyle</strong></p>
